## About
Intergalactic Space Junk was created by Johan SÃ¶gaard (Youhan / Flimsy) as a part of OpenJam 2017. The game is set in a not so far future where earthgarbage for many years has left its mark on our planet. But now, an even greater threat is facing our homeworld... INTERGALACTIC JUNK! You need to control your rocketpowered space-trash-can and collect all that junk before it reaches the surface of our planet!
